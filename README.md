## VoteBlocks 

# **Introduction**

The current voting scenario is quite unappealing. Especially for people living away from their own constituency. This problem can be solved using online decentralized voting system which is made reliable, transparent and secure using blockchain.

VoteBlocks is a decentralised platform which does exactly that. The user can enter their details including their voter id and the delegate to whom they prefer to vote ("none" option available). In addition to this even if the user is using the app in an area where the network connectivity is not good or there is no network connection, can use the app. After the user votes, when the network connection is available the user's vote will automatically be counted and saved in the blockchain. The person will be remembered in the blockchain and will be prevented from voting for the second time. Vote counting is **automatic** and **completely transparent** at the same time. At the end of the voting time, the delegate with the largest number of votes will be displayed along with the number of votes.
