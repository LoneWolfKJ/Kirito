The current voting scenario is quite unappealing. Especially for people living away from their own constituency. This problem can be solved using online decentralized voting system which is made reliable, transparent and secure using blockchain.

VoteBlocks is a platform which does exactly that. The user can enter their details including their voter id and the delegate to whom they prefer to vote ("none" option available).
